General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, 
is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 
and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. 
General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of 
universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric 
property of space and time or four dimensional spacetime. 
In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and 
momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified 
by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.
