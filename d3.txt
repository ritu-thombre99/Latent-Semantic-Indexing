Quantum teleportation is a process in which quantum information 
like the exact state of an atom or photonthat can be transmitted 
(exactly, in principle) from one location to another, with the help of classical 
communication and previously shared quantum entanglement between the sending and 
receiving location. Because it depends on classical communication, 
which can proceed no faster than the speed of light, it cannot be used for 
faster than light transport or communication of classical bits. 
While it has proven possible to teleport one or more qubits of information 
between two (entangled) quanta, this has not yet been achieved between anything 
larger than molecules.
